## üåê Deployment with Vite

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  **Configure `vite.config.js`:**
    Set the `base` property in your `vite.config.js` file to your repository name. This is crucial for GitHub Pages to find your assets correctly.

    ```javascript
    // vite.config.js
    import { defineConfig } from "vite";
    import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [react()],
      base: "/paradise-nursery/",
    });
    ```

2.  **Install `gh-pages`:**

    ```sh
    npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

3.  **Add deploy scripts to `package.json`:**
    Vite builds the project into a `dist` folder. The deploy script needs to target this folder.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "paradise-nursery",
      "homepage": "https://213020aumc.github.io/paradise-nursery",
      // ...
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview",
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```

4.  **Deploy the application:**
    This command will build your project and push the `dist` folder to a `gh-pages` branch on your repository.
    ```sh
    npm run deploy
    ```
    Your site will be live at the `homepage` URL in your `package.json`.
